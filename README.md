response of gpt before jailbreaking: I'm sorry, but as of my last update in January 2022, there's no information available about an "ICF Cricket World Championship" in 2023. It's possible that the tournament you're referring to may be a fictional or hypothetical event, or it may have been established after my last update. If you have any other questions or if you're referring to a different cricket championship, please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you.
